Multiple imputation creates multiple complete versions of the dataset by filling missing values differently each time.
Each imputed dataset represents a plausible scenario for the missing data. Models are trained separately on each imputed dataset,
and results are combined, allowing for proper handling of uncertainty caused by missingness. 
This leads to more honest, statistically valid conclusions compared to single imputation.
