Main Concepts from FIMD about Longitudinal Data Imputation:

- Longitudinal data has a natural time structure: repeated measures from the same subject over time.

- Simple imputation methods (e.g., mean, median) are inappropriate because they ignore the time-dependency of measurements.

- LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) and NOCB (Next Observation Carried Backward) can be used for short gaps but are generally crude solutions.

- Linear interpolation and spline interpolation are preferred for longitudinal data because they respect the continuous and gradual nature of changes over time.

- Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) can be used, but it must respect clustering by subject ID:
  - Ideally, imputation should be done separately within each subject.
  - Alternatively, subject ID should be included as a predictor in the imputation model.

- Advanced methods like mixed models or time-series-specific models (e.g., random slopes) can better account for individual trajectories, but are more complex to implement.

- General Recommendation:
  - For smooth biological processes (e.g., gait speed, steps), linear or spline interpolation is preferred.
  - For more flexible, model-driven filling, MICE is appropriate if applied carefully with awareness of subjects' grouping.

Multivariate vs Univariate MICE Imputation Design

We updated the impute_missing_data() function to allow flexible use of MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations).

New behavior:
- If multivariate=True:
  - MICE imputes all selected features together.
  - The imputation uses information across columns (e.g., gait speed, steps).
  - This improves accuracy by capturing relationships between features.
- If multivariate=False:
  - MICE imputes each column separately.
  - Useful when features should be imputed independently.

The multivariate option gives users the flexibility to control how imputations are performed depending on the data and experimental needs.

Example Usage:
- Multivariate MICE: impute_missing_data(daily_df, columns=[...], method='mice', multivariate=True)
- Univariate MICE: impute_missing_data(daily_df, columns=[...], method='mice', multivariate=False)

This design allows the imputation system to be easily adapted for different strategies while keeping the function clean and modular.

Based on "VAEs in the Presence of Missing Data," we identified several imputation strategies tailored for structured or longitudinal datasets:

1. Model missingness as a corruption process rather than a latent variable (x̃ = m ⋅ x + (1−m) ⋅ μ or 0).
2. Use a conditional VAE where both encoder and decoder are aware of the missingness mask.
3. This framework supports MCAR, MAR, and MNAR data — which is critical for real-world longitudinal sensor data.
4. Recommended configurations include:
   - ED Ind. (Encoder + Decoder aware of missingness)
   - Corruption-based VAE training with access to the mask during inference.
5. These approaches outperform zero-imputation or simple masking, particularly when missingness is structured or related to outcomes (MNAR).

Added mask-aware features to the model input to indicate which values were originally missing and imputed. These binary features (0 = observed, 1 = imputed) 
are used as auxiliary signals during modeling, helping the LSTM learn to handle uncertain or less reliable inputs. 
This method improves model robustness and aligns with best practices in modeling longitudinal data with irregular missingness.
